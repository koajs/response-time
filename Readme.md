[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/koajs/response-time.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

 X-Response-Time middleware for Koa v2.

## Installation

```js
$ npm install koa-response-time
```

## Usage

  Basic usage:

```js
var Koa = require('koa');
var responseTime = require('koa-response-time');
var app = new Koa();

app.use(responseTime());
```

  If you need response high resolution in nano time, set `hrtime` option to `true`:

```js
app.use(responseTime(hrtime: true));
```


  Sample response header with `hrtime = false` (default):

```
X-Response-Time: 153ms
```

  Sample response header with `hrtime = true`:

```
X-Response-Time: 153.123581ms
```

## Note

  Best to `.use()` at the _top_ before any other middleware,
  to wrap all subsequent middleware.
